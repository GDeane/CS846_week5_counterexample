## 1. Counterexample Problems

### Problem A_1: Summarize Legacy Code

**Task Description:**  

Generate a clear and concise summary of the javascript processOrder function described in processOrder_example.js

**Starter Code:**  

The function and example test file is found in https://github.com/GDeane/CS846_week5_counterexample/tree/main/Week5/A_1.

### 2. Guidelines that didn't work for Problem A_1

#### Guideline 2: Explicitly Constrain Summary Length

The original guideline assumes that brevity improves clarity and reduces "fluff" (like error handling).
However, in complex code such as legacy enterprise code, the "how" and the "edge cases" become vital pieces of information.

By strictly constraining the length to 20 words or less, the LLM is forced to aggresively abstract away complexity. This
causes the model to omit implementation details such as code side-effects that are necessary for a developer to know.

A prudent use case for using generative AI to summarize code is in understanding and debugging legacy code. This type of code is
often overloaded and side-effect heavy, meaning a longer summary is necessary for correctness, safety, and understanding.

Constraining the summary length in this case can cause an oversimplified understanding of the code, leading to dangerous assumptions.

**Prompt and Context:**  

Context Given: processOrder_example.js test_processOrder_example.js

> "Please generate a brief description in one sentence of the function processOrder (max 20 words)." 

**Solution or Output generated by GitHub Copilot:**  

> `Processes an order by charging payment, sending email, updating caches and audit logs, and handling offline/retry flows.`

**Why this is sub-optimal:**

While this summary could be considered concise, it is **dangerous** due to it omitting several 'invisible' behaviors of
the above legacy code.

In reality, this is very "dirty" legacy code with many high-risk side effects, such as:
- the function quietly mutates the overrides object passed to it, something the developer may not know about.
- The function uses `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.appendFileSync`, which block the entire event loop in Node.js and will freeze
  the server everytime it writes an audit log or reads the config.
- The function is **not stateless**. It modifies globalState when called, and its behavior depends on previous calls.

A good summary of this code should act as a warning label for developers that notes these kinds of obvious side effects.

### 3. New and Updated Guidelines that worked for Problem A_1

#### Guideline 2 (Revised): Context-Aware Length Scaling

**Description:**

Ask the LLM to be clear and concise (high output information density), rather than imposing a hard word limit.
Summaries should prioritize **functional completeness** over strict word counts for sensitive tasks.

**Reasoning:**

Strict constraints lead to over-generalization, where specific logic is replaced by vague verbs. This is dangerous
when the true complexity is much higher than a 20-word constraint would permit.

**Prompt and Context:**  

Context Given: processOrder_example.js test_processOrder_example.js

> "Summarize the processOrder function in a clear and concise manner (max 20 words). Exception: If the code includes non-standard
side-effects, you must add a 'Note' section highlighting each of these risks."

**Solution or Output generated by GitHub Copilot:**  

Summary ✅
- Processes an order: loads config, charges payment, sends email, caches/audits, queues work, and returns via callback. (16 words)

`Note ⚠️:
- **Mutates global state (globalState):** updates lastOrderId and increments retryCount — can leak across calls/tests.
- **Mutates caller argument (overrides):** adds _touchedAt and meta.startedBy — unexpected external mutation.
- **Synchronous disk I/O (fs.readFileSync, appendFileSync):** blocks the event loop and may degrade performance.
- **Audit side-channel:** writes START before success and DONE later — can produce inconsistent or misleading audit records.
- **Delayed post-callback effects (setTimeout):** updates cache, metrics, and audit after callback returns — state changes occur asynchronously.
- **External side-effects:** calls paymentGateway.charge, emailClient.send, and queue.push — depends on/affects external systems and retries.
- **Environment-dependent behavior:** uses process.env and fallback config, altering behavior based on runtime environment.
  `

**Result:**

The summary is longer, but it is closer to **optimal** because it captures the "hidden" behavior that a developer must
know to avoid introducing further bugs. Any developer I know would prefer
